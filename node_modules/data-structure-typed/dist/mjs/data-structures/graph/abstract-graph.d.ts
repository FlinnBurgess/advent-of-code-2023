     * Tarjan is an algorithm based on dfs,which is used to solve the connectivity problem of graphs.
     * Tarjan can find cycles in directed or undirected graph
     * Tarjan can find the articulation points and bridges(critical edgeMap) of undirected graphs in linear time,
     * Tarjan solve the bi-connected components of undirected graphs;
     * Tarjan can find the SSC(strongly connected components), articulation points, and bridges of directed graphs.
     * The `tarjan` function is used to perform various graph analysis tasks such as finding articulation points, bridges,
     * strongly connected components (SCCs), and cycles in a graph.
     * @param {boolean} [needCutVertexes] - A boolean value indicating whether or not to calculate and return the
     * articulation points in the graph. Articulation points are the vertexMap in a graph whose removal would increase the
     * number of connected components in the graph.
     * @param {boolean} [needBridges] - A boolean flag indicating whether the algorithm should find and return the bridges
     * (edgeMap whose removal would increase the number of connected components in the graph).
     * @param {boolean} [needSCCs] - A boolean value indicating whether the Strongly Connected Components (SCCs) of the
     * graph are needed. If set to true, the function will calculate and return the SCCs of the graph. If set to false, the
     * SCCs will not be calculated or returned.
     * @param {boolean} [needCycles] - A boolean flag indicating whether the algorithm should find cycles in the graph. If
     * set to true, the algorithm will return a map of cycles, where the keys are the low values of the SCCs and the values
     * are arrays of vertexMap that form cycles within the SCCs.
     * @returns The function `tarjan` returns an object with the following properties:
